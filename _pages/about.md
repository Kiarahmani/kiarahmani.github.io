## About

I am an applied scientist working at the intersection of **programming languages, formal methods, and modern AI systems**.  
My recent work focuses on **LLM-based program synthesis, agent orchestration, and evaluation infrastructure** for real-world applications.

I’m a founding engineer at [Durable](https://durable.ai/), where we work on **reliable agent/program synthesis from product requirement documents**, multi-API integration, and automated QA/repair pipelines for LLM agents.

Before that, I was a post-doctoral researcher at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) with [Isil Dillig](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~isil/) and [Joydeep Biswas](https://www.joydeepb.com/), and I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Purdue University](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) with [Suresh Jagannathan](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/suresh/) and [Ben Delaware](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/bendy/). I also spent time at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/) working with [Sumit Gulwani](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/sumitg/) on **LLM-guided program synthesis** in 2020. 

I like problems that combine **abstract reasoning** (logic, semantics, verification) with **messy real systems** (databases, agents, APIs, robots).

## What I work on

- **LLM agents & program synthesis** – building systems that translate natural language into reliable, debuggable code and workflows.
- **Integration & infra** – connecting LLM agents to external APIs (Slack, Google, Salesforce, etc.), with testing, logging, and automated repair.
- **RAG, QA, and evaluation** – pipelines that simulate real users, surface failures, and automatically suggest fixes.
- **Neurosymbolic & formal methods** – combining temporal logic, model checking, and program analysis with learning-based systems.
- **Distributed data & consistency** – reasoning about weakly consistent databases and refactoring schemas to eliminate subtle concurrency bugs.
